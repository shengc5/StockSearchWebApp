# StockSearchWebApp
This is a single page application(SPA) I created to help people who are active in the stock market game to keep track of the stocks they are interested in.

It can serve as a standalone utility(much like macOS's dashboard applications) for user to quickly look up trade info or news about their stocks. You can also save stocks to your favorite list, and turn on the auto-refresh to see the latest prices/indicators every time your eyes land on the page.

This app is written using AngularJS and Node
